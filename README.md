It is an inventory and crafting work done in a game in Unity.
As seen in the images below, the items on the ground can be picked up with the E key.

Items we Picked up appear in our Inventory. (Press I to open inventory)

When we press the crafting button, if the green color appears, it means that we have the required number of items for the crafting process.
So when we click here, a new item will be created.

If red color appears, it means that the items required for crafting are not in our inventory.
